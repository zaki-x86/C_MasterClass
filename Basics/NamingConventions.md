# C Naming Conventions #

We do care about how we name our variables!

1. Don't start variable name with a digit.
2. Starting the name with an underscore is valid but not recommended.
3. C is case sensitive.
4. Special characters are not allowed.
5. White spaces are not allowed.
6. Don't use keywords for variable names.
7. Keep variable names as short and meaningful as possible.
